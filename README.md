# Telco Agent Skills

Telco Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that AI agents can discover and use to perform specific tasks related to the Telecommunications industry. This repository provides a catalog of skills tailored for Telco use cases, enabling agents to interact with standardized APIs and systems.

## The Standard

Each skill is designed to be a self-contained unit that an AI agent can use. The `SKILL.md` file within each skill's directory provides a detailed description of the skill's capabilities, expected inputs, and operational workflow. The goal is to create a standardized approach for building and using Telco-related skills.

A key example is the `tmf-mcp-builder` skill, which demonstrates how to build TM Forum (TMF) compliant Management Component Platform (MCP) servers from TMF OpenAPI specifications.


## Available Skills

## License

The license for an individual skill can be found in the `LICENSE.txt` file within the skill's directory.
